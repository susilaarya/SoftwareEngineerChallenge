Countly bills itself as a "secure web analytics" platform. While I can't vouch for its security, 
Countly does a solid job of collecting and presenting data about your site and its visitors.
Heavily targeting marketing organizations, Countly tracks data that is important to marketers. 
That information includes site visitors' transactions, as well as which campaigns and sources led visitors to your site. 
You can also create metrics that are specific to your business. 
Countly doesn't forgo basic web analytics; it also keeps track of the number of visitors on your site, 
where they're from, which pages they visited, and more.
You can use the hosted version of Countly or grab the source code from GitHub and self-host the application.
And yes, there are differences between the hosted and self-hosted versions of Countly.
